            <li>I love to feed people tasty food! It's one of my main ways to show I care.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy when little kids who are learning to write misspell things in smart creative ways. Usually, their version makes more sense than the 'correct' version. My favorite recent misspelling was on a birthday card: 'esqishaly' instead of 'especially'. So logical!</li>
            <li>My cat keeps trying to sit on my keyboard while I work on Prime homework. It's less helpful than he thinks it is.</li>
